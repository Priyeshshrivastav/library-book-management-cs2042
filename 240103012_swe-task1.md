**Assignment Title**: SWE Task-1: Library Book Management System
**Course Code**: CS2042

## 2. Problem Statement
The assignment required the development of a Library Book Management System in Python based on Agile methodology. Key requirements included using the `unittest` framework, adhering to a 3-sprint cycle, managing code versioning with Git (feature branches, merges, tags), and ensuring complete traceability from user stories to implementation and testing.

## 3. Agile Plan (Sprint-wise)
- **Sprint 1**: Focus on basic book management.
  - **Goal**: Implement `add_book` and duplicate ID validation.
  - **Deliverable**: `feature/sprint-1` merged to `main`, tagged `v0.1`.
- **Sprint 2**: Focus on borrowing logic.
  - **Goal**: Implement `borrow_book` and `return_book` with status updates.
  - **Deliverable**: `feature/sprint-2` merged to `main`, tagged `v0.2`.
- **Sprint 3**: Focus on reporting.
  - **Goal**: Implement `generate_report` to list inventory.
  - **Deliverable**: `feature/sprint-3` merged to `main`, tagged `v0.3`.

## 4. Implementation Summary
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Storage**: In-memory dictionary (`self.books`).
- **Sprint 1**: Implemented `Library` class initialization and `add_book` logic to store book details (ID, Title, Author, Status).
- **Sprint 2**: Added state transitions. `borrow_book` changes status to 'borrowed'; `return_book` reverts it to 'available'. Added validations for non-existent books and invalid states.
- **Sprint 3**: Added `generate_report` to format the stored data into a readable pipe-separated table string.

## 5. Testing Summary
- **Test Framework**: `unittest`
- **Total Test Cases**: 10
  - **Sprint 1**: 2 tests (Add success, Duplicate ID).
  - **Sprint 2**: 5 tests (Borrow success, Already borrowed error, Borrow not found, Return success, Return not found).
  - **Sprint 3**: 3 tests (Report header presence, Report content verification, Borrowed status in report).
- **Command Used**: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v`
- **Result**: All tests passed successfully.

## 6. Traceability
- **Explanation**: The traceability matrix maps each requirement (via User Story) to the specific code implementation, the unit test that verifies it, and the Git tag where it was delivered.

**Full Traceability Table**:

| User Story | Sprint | Code File | Test Case | Git Tag |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Add Book | 1 | src/library.py | test_add_book_success | v0.1 |
| Duplicate ID | 1 | src/library.py | test_add_book_duplicate_id | v0.1 |
| Borrow Book | 2 | src/library.py | test_borrow_book_success | v0.2 |
| Borrow Error (Borrowed) | 2 | src/library.py | test_borrow_book_already_borrowed | v0.2 |
| Borrow Error (Not Found) | 2 | src/library.py | test_borrow_book_not_found | v0.2 |
| Return Book | 2 | src/library.py | test_return_book_success | v0.2 |
| Return Error (Not Found) | 2 | src/library.py | test_return_book_not_found | v0.2 |
| Generate Report | 3 | src/library.py | test_report_header | v0.3 |
| Report Content | 3 | src/library.py | test_report_content | v0.3 |

## 7. Git Evidence
The following log demonstrates the commit history, branching, and tagging workflow:

```
* 428ac5f (HEAD -> main, tag: v0.3, origin/main, origin/feature/sprint-3, feature/sprint-3) Sprint 3 complete: Report generation
*   edeacae (tag: v0.2, origin/feature/sprint-2, feature/sprint-2) Sprint 2 complete: Borrow and Return features
|\  
| * ...
* | 4397a23 (tag: v0.1, origin/feature/sprint-1, feature/sprint-1) Sprint 1 complete: Add book and tests
|/  
* (Initial commit / checkout point)
```

- **Feature Branches**: Used `feature/sprint-1`, `feature/sprint-2`, `feature/sprint-3` for development.
- **Main Branch**: Only received code via merges after sprint completion.
- **Tags**: Versioned releases `v0.1`, `v0.2`, `v0.3` mark the end of each sprint.

## 8. Conclusion
I successfully completed the Library Book Management System assignment. I gained practical experience in:
- Implementing an Agile development cycle with strict separation of concerns per sprint.
- Managing code quality through continuous unit testing (`unittest`).
- utilizing Git for version control, specifically handling feature branches, merging, and tagging releases.
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation (User Stories, Traceability) alongside code.
The final system is fully functional, tested, and documented according to the specifications.
